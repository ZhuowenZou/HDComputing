Quantized (BT, binarizes) vs Polarize (PL):

Quantized evaluation and preprocessing maps everything to bits. i.e. to 0 ~ 2^(nbits)
	Conduc.
Polarized maps everything to values -2^(nbits)/2 ~ 2^(nbits)/2.
	Cos


One_pass:
1. Train: Naive addition on non-linear model with standard evaluation
2. Inference: processed model with respective evaluation (polarized, quantized, etc)

Quantization:

2 
[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]



Retrain:
1. Train: Naive add+sub with batch update.
	1. Inference is done with respective evaluation, meaning that the model is processed and then used for inference. 
	2. Original model is updated on the go, but the processed model for inference in updated every batch.
