Single-lined graphs: 
	named by their Regen rate 
Multilined graph:
	IterAligned: graph is aligned by number of iteration ran 	on each model
	RegenAligned: graph is aligned by number of regeneration went through on each model
	[sm] med/max-smooth: graph after smoothing by a degree of sm. Graph is generated by sampling the medium(med) or max of the interval of length sm. Thus, sm = 1 have no smoothness.
