x-axis: HD Dimensions/Indices
y-axis: Regeneration count, from top to bottom
Name of the picture: Regen frequency
Graph:
	Black: dimensions not changed in that iteration
	White: dimensions changed in that iteration
	The gradient color (between black and white): added effect to demonstrate that the new dimension "settled in". Are treated as black (not changed) in binary-color graph
